# NSP Update
Didn't find a simple way to scan NSP folder for possible updates, so made this little tool

This program relies on an updates from https://github.com/blawar/nut

It downloads the title and versions json files and compares it to the local NSP files.

Local NSP files should be contains the titleId and version (for example ```Super Mario Odyssey [0100000000010000][v0].nsp```)
